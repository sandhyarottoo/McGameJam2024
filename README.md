## TITLE


So you have chosen to pursue graduate studies in physics...hard enough as it is, but what if a troublemaking contraption showed up and messed up the laws of physics? Aside from messing up much of the major infrastructure that holds society together, this also prevents you from taking your measurements. And that's unnacceptable, quite frankly. 

In order to take your measurements and satisfy your PI, you must find this evil contraption and turn it off so that the world can go back to the way it was. Dodge charged bullets to catch the contraption and finally battle it out floating above a plane of charge. Time is running out, you've got to write that paper! That RFI isn't going to stop itself.
